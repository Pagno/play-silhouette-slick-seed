Silhouette Slick Seed Template
==============================

This is a fork of the official Silhouette Seed project. If you want to have a first look at Silhouette, I suggest you have a look at the [official project](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette-seed)

The Silhouette Slick Seed project is an Activator template which shows how [Silhouette](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette) can be implemented in a Play Framework application. It uses the [play-slick](https://github.com/playframework/play-slick) library for database access.

## Example

Currently, there is no running example of this template.

## Features

## Documentation

If you need help with the integration of Silhouette into your project, don't hesitate and ask questions in our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-silhouette) or on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/playframework).
